# AutomatedMandelbulbExplorer
The goal of this project is to use parallel GPU computing to produce efficiently images of 3D fractals and “stitch” them together into a video.
You are given prototype serial code developed by T. Gwosdz and N. Nedialkov, which you can improve further and parallelize. You can download it from http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/COURSES/4f03/private/MandelBoxCode.zip. (Typing make creates the executable mandelbox.) This code produces Mandelbox images. It is based on ray marching (also called ray casting).
